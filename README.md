# .files

These are my dotfiles. Take anything you want, but at your own risk.

Much of this is based on how [Lars Kappert](https://github.com/webpro/) has set his system up. A good amount of bits and inspiration from [Dan Lowe](https://github.com/tangledhelix) here as well.

This mess targets macOS systems, but has some checks to make lots of it work on *nix as well. macOS stuff is at very least broken out into its own files.

## Post Installation 

* Tower CLI Tool - To install the `gittower` command line tool, run installer from Tower's preferences on the Integration tab. (Make sure that Tower is run from the /Applications folder before trying to install.)


## Install

On a sparkling fresh installation of OS X:

    sudo softwareupdate -i -a
    xcode-select --install

Note: update `COMPUTER_NAME` constant in [osx/defaults.sh](https://raw.github.com/dropkick/dotfiles/master/osx/defaults.sh) with correct/current machine name before firing that script.

Install the dotfiles with either Git or curl:

### Clone with Git

    git clone https://github.com/dropkick/dotfiles.git
    source dotfiles/install.sh

### Remotely install using curl

Alternatively, you can install this into `~/.dotfiles` remotely without Git using curl:

    sh -c "`curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/dropkick/dotfiles/master/remote-install.sh`"

Or, using wget:

    sh -c "`wget -O - --no-check-certificate https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dropkick/dotfiles/master/remote-install.sh`"

## The `dotfiles` command

    $ dotfiles help
    Usage: dotfiles <command>

    Commands:
       help             This help message
       edit             Open dotfiles in editor ($EDITOR_ALT) and Git GUI ($GIT_GUI)
       reload           Reload dotfiles
       test             Run tests
       update           Update packages and pkg managers (OS, brew, npm, gem, pip)
       clean            Clean up caches (brew, npm, gem, rvm)
       osx              Apply OS X system defaults
       dock             Apply OS X Dock settings
       install vundle   Install Vundle

## Customize/extend

You can put your custom settings, such as Git credentials in the `system/.custom` file which will be sourced from `.bash_profile` automatically. This file is in `.gitignore`.

Alternatively, you can have an additional, personal dotfiles repo at `~/.extra`.

* The runcom `.bash_profile` sources all `~/.extra/runcom/*.sh` files.
* The installer (`install.sh`) will run `~/.extra/install.sh`.
