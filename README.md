# .files

These are my dotfiles. Take anything you want, but at your own risk.

Much of this is based on how [Lars Kappert](https://github.com/webpro/) has set his system up. A good amount of bits and inspiration from [Dan Lowe](https://github.com/tangledhelix) here as well.

This mess targets macOS systems, but has some checks to make lots of it work on *nix as well. macOS stuff is at very least broken out into its own files.

## Install

On a sparkling fresh installation of macOS:

    sudo softwareupdate -i -a
    xcode-select --install

Note: update `COMPUTER_NAME` constant in [macos/defaults.sh](https://raw.github.com/dropkick/dotfiles/master/macos/defaults.sh) with correct/current machine name before firing that script.

Install the dotfiles with either Git or curl:

### Clone with Git

    git clone https://github.com/dropkick/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
    source ~/.dotfiles/install.sh

### Remotely install using curl

Alternatively, you can install this into `~/.dotfiles` remotely without Git using curl:

    bash -c "`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dropkick/dotfiles/master/remote-install.sh`"

Or, using wget:

bash -c "`wget -O - --no-check-certificate https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dropkick/dotfiles/master/remote-install.sh`"

## The `dotfiles` command

    $ dotfiles help
    Usage: dotfiles <command>

    Commands:
       clean            Clean up caches (brew, npm, gem, rvm)
       dock             Apply macOS Dock settings
       edit             Open dotfiles in IDE (code) and Git GUI (stree)
       help             This help message
       macos            Apply macOS system defaults
       test             Run tests
       update           Update packages and pkg managers (OS, brew, npm, gem)

## Customize/extend

You can put your custom settings, such as Git credentials in the `system/.custom` file which will be sourced from `.bash_profile` automatically. This file is in `.gitignore`.

Alternatively, you can have an additional, personal dotfiles repo at `~/.extra`.

* The installer (`install.sh`) will run `~/.extra/install.sh`.
* The runcom `.bash_profile` sources all `~/.extra/runcom/*.sh` files.
